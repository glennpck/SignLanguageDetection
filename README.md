# SignLanguageDetection
This project applies Python Development and Machine Learning to create a Facecam feature that can identify the different American Sign Language Alphabets through training a Machine Learning Model

# Development Stages
- Stage 1: Hand Capture (Canvas) and Data Collection
- Stage 2: Development of Classifier Model
- Stage 3: Model Training
- Stage 4: Integration of Model into Hand Capture

# Alphabets Learned by Model:
B, D, E, F (Possible to add more VIA means of bigger dataset)
